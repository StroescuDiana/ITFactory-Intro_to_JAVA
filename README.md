# ITFactory Intro to Java

<!-- Introduction -->
Welcome to my ITFactory Intro to Java! This repository showcases the knowledge and skills I've acquired in the Java programming language through the ITFactory Java introductory course.

## Java Basics

Throughout the ITFactory Intro to Java course, I've covered fundamental concepts of Java programming, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: I've learned about classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

- **Data Structures**: I've gained proficiency in working with arrays, lists, and maps in Java.

- **Control Structures**: I can effectively use for loops, while loops, and conditional statements (if-else) to control program flow.

- **Functions**: I'm skilled in creating and using functions to modularize code.

- **Operators**: I can work with Java operators to manipulate data.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure to demonstrate practical applications of my Java knowledge:

- **src/**
    - `OOP/`: Object-Oriented Programming with a pasta recipe :)
    - `Array/`: Arrays
    - `Array_advanced/`: Array List
    - `for_loop/`: For Loops
    - `functii/`: Functions
    - `HelloWorld/`: Hello World
    - `Liste/`: Lists
    - `Maps/`: Maps
    - `Operatori/`: Operators
    - `Switch/`: Switch
    - `UserInput/`: Scanner
    - `Variabile/`: Variables
    - `While/`: While Loops

In each of these directories, you'll find Java code files related to specific Java topics and exercises from the course.


Thank you for taking the time to review my ITFactory Intro to Java repository. I look forward to the possibility of working together!
